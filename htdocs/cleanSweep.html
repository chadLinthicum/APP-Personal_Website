        <h1>Clean Sweep</h1>
        <span>
          Clean Sweep is an exhilarating first-person on-rails shooter that
          thrusts players into the heart-pounding action of navigating down a
          treacherous river on a military boat. Armed with precision and speed,
          players must utilize their shooting skills to take down an onslaught
          of challenging targets in the form of barrels. The objective is clear:
          achieve the highest score possible by obliterating as many barrels as
          possible within the given time limit. As players skillfully maneuver
          through the rushing waters, they are faced with ever-increasing
          obstacles and challenging environmental conditions that put their
          accuracy and reflexes to the ultimate test. With its immersive
          gameplay, realistic graphics, and adrenaline-pumping challenges, Clean
          Sweep delivers an experience that will keep players on the edge of
          their seats as they strive to dominate the leader boards and become
          the ultimate sharpshooter.
